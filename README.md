# FinanceTrackerv3
My take on a Python based Finance Tracker.

Please feel free to improve upon the code, use the application, etc. My current request is that you do not close the code and attempt to sell/distribute the code in that manner.

In addition, please do not remove any tags that give credit to creators. When making improvements to the code, feel free to add your name to the developer list in the code comments.
